# FIXIT

This project was conducted from 22.04.26. to 22.05.27. as a Software Engineering course in the 1st semester of the 3rd year of Gachon University.

We implemented this app to provide information related to computer repair to people who can't fix it themselves when their computer breaks down, reducing expensive repair bills.
